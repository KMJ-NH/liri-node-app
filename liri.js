//Here there will be code written to grab the data from keys.js. The keys will be stored in a variable.

//This file will be able to take in one of the following commands:
  //my-tweets
  //spotify-this-song
  //movie-this
  //do-what-it-says


  // TWITTER SECTION
  //The command should do this -- node liri.js my-tweets  -- which would show that last 20 tweets and when they were created.


  // SPOTIFY SECTION
  //The command would also do -- node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
    //This would display in the terminal window:
      // Artist(s)
      // The song's name
      // A preview link of the song from Spotify
      // The album that the song is from
      // If no song is provided then the program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.


  // OMDB SECTION
  //The command would also do -- node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
    //This would display in the terminal window:
      //  Title of the movie
      //  Year the movie came out
      //  IMDB rating of the movie
      //  Rotten Tomatoes rating of the movie
      //  Country where the movie was produced
      //  Language of the movie
      //  Plot of the movie
      //  Actors in the movie
      //  If no movie is typed in, data for the moive 'Mr. Nobody' will be displayed

    // The fs Node package will be used for LIRI to use the text inside random.txt to call one of LIRI's commands
      // This means it would run spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way," as the random.txt file contained that text
